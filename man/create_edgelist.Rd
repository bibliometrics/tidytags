\title{Create an edgelist where senders and receivers are defined by different types
  of Twitter interactions}
\usage{
create_edgelist(df, type = "all")
}
\arguments{
\item{df}{A dataframe returned by \code{pull_tweet_data()}}

\item{type}{The specific kind of statuses used to define the interactions
around which the edgelist will be built. Choices include"reply", "retweet",
"quote", or "mention." Defaults to "all."}
}
\value{
A dataframe edgelist defined by interactions through the type of
  statuses specified. The dataframe has three columns: \code{sender},
  \code{receiver}, and \code{edge_type}.
}
\description{
Starting with a dataframe returned by \code{pull_tweet_data()},
  \code{create_edgelist()} processes the statuses by calling
  \code{process_tweets()}, filters the dataset to only keep the specific
  status types (e.g., replies, retweets, quote tweets, and mentions)
  requested by calling \code{filter_by_tweet_type()}, pulls out senders and
  receivers of the specified type of statuses, and then adds a new column.
  \code{edge_type}.
