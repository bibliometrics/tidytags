\title{Retrieve user information for everyone in an edgelist}
\usage{
add_users_data(edgelist)
}
\arguments{
\item{edgelist}{An edgelist of senders and receivers, such as that returned
by the function \code{create_edgelist()}.}
}
\value{
A dataframe in the form of an edgelist (i.e., with senders and
  receivers) as well as numerous, appropriately named columns of details
  about the senders and receivers.
}
\description{
Updates an edgelist created with \code{create_edgelist()} by appending user
  data retrieved with \code{rtweet::lookup_users()}. The resulting dataframe
  keeps all the columns from \code{rtweet} but adds "_sender" or "_receiver"
  to the column names.
